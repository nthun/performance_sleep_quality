# Aim
We want to investigate the effect of poor sleep quality on cognitive performance. 
Two sleep quality questionnaires and several cognitive tests were administered across 
three studies.  

First, we want to aggregate the sleep quality questionnaires into one 
sleep quality metric. Then we want to investigate the association while controlling for 
the potential effect of the separate studies. Subsequently, we want to obtain 
Bayes Factors, so we can draw conclusions about the probability of null or alternative 
hypothesis.

# Principal component analysis of sleep quality

We conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate the two sleep quality 
measures into one. 

```{r}
sleepd_pca <- 
  df %>% 
  select(ais_ossz, psqi_osszpont) %>% 
  psych::pca(nfactors = 1)

# Show PCA result
sleepd_pca

bartlett_result <- 
  df %>% 
  select(ais_ossz, psqi_osszpont) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  psych::cortest.bartlett(n = 235)

# Add the PC to the original data 
df <- 
  df %>% 
  mutate(sleep_disturb = sleepd_pca$scores[,1])
```

The Bartlett's test of shericity indicated that the correlation between the scales were
adequately large for a PCA, $\chi^2(235)$ = `r round(bartlett_result$chisq, 2)`, p < .0001.

One principal factor with an eigenvalue of `r round(sleepd_pca$values[1], 2)` was extracted to represent 
sleep disturbance. The component explained `r scales::percent(sleepd_pca$fit.off)` of the 
variance, and it was named sleep disturbance. 

# Exploraton of important variables
```{r}
skimr::skim_with(numeric = list(hist = NULL)) # Remove spark histograms
df %>% 
  select(one_of(variables_needed)) %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

# Checking hypotheses
First, we create several linear mixed-effects models (LMEM) with the same predictor (sleep disturbance), and the cognitive performance metrics as outcomes. The LMEM contains a 
random intercept term by study to account for the potential differences between studies.

```{r warning=FALSE}
all_models <- 
  df %>% 
  select(one_of(variables_needed)) %>% 
  gather(outcome_var, value, -sleep_disturb, -study) %>% 
  split(.$outcome_var) %>% 
  map(., ~lmer(scale(value) ~ scale(sleep_disturb) + (1|study), REML = FALSE,
               data = .x))

# From the models, we can get the  standardized betas for the slopes and p the values
# We recalculate the models using restricted likelihood for this, so the estimated parameters will be more accurate

models <- 
  all_models %>% 
  map(~update(.x, REML = TRUE)) %>% 
  map(~broom::tidy(.)) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "outcome_var") %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(term, "(Intercept)|.Residual")) %>% 
  # Add number of observations by hand and calculate the two-sided p statistic 
  # based on t value and residual df
  mutate(n = c(rep(231, 11), 225),
         p = 2*pt(q = -abs(statistic), df = n - 1))

knitr::kable(models, digits = 4)
```

The LMEMs show no evidences that the cognitive metrics were affected by poor sleep quality.

# Calculate Bayes Factors ($BF_{01}$)

In order to make prediction about the likelihood of the null hypothesis - as compared to
the alternative hypothesis - we calculated the Bayes Factor [@Wagenmakers2007].
To calculate the BIC derived Bayes Factor, we calculated the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for null models that only included a fixed intercept, and a random intercept term by study. Maximum Likelihood estimation was used so the models could be compared. The $BF_{01}$ were calculated based on @Wagenmakers2007. 

```{r}
# BF was calculated based on this tutoerial: https://rpubs.com/lindeloev/bayes_factors
# Calculate BIC for NULL models
null_BIC <-
  df %>%
  select(one_of(variables_needed)) %>% 
  gather(outcome_var, value, -sleep_disturb, -study) %>% 
  split(.$outcome_var) %>%
  map_df(., ~lmer(scale(value) ~ 1 + (1|study), REML = FALSE, 
                  data = .x) %>% 
           broom::glance(.) %>% 
           select(nullBIC = BIC),
         .id = "outcome_var") 

# Calculate BF01 for all models
all_models %>% 
  map_df(~broom::glance(.),
         .id = "outcome_var") %>%
  left_join(null_BIC, by = "outcome_var") %>%
  mutate(BF01 = exp((BIC - nullBIC)/2)) %>% 
  select(outcome_var, BF01) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)

```

As all BFs were over 3, we can conclude that the cognitive performance of the study
population seems to be unaffected by poor sleep.
